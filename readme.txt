== Description ==

A very basic sales tax reporting tool for WooCommerce. Get annual reports of sales tax collected in the United States, broken down by ZIP code, and also including state-level totals. Displays results in a clean tabular layout in the WordPress admin interface, as well as a downloadable CSV.

**PLEASE NOTE:** This is a free tool, provided AS-IS with no warranty. Room 34 Creative Services, LLC accepts no liability for any inaccurate information. This plugin simply consolidates data stored by WooCommerce and cannot perform any tax calculations.

"Average Tax Rate" indicated in the report does **NOT** indicate the correct tax rate for the given ZIP code; it is an average based on the actual tax amounts and order totals reported by WooCommerce on the orders placed during the reporting period.
